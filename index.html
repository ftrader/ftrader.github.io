<h1>Weekly musing #15 - Signs of growth</h1>

<h2>ABC contributors growing</h2>

<p>The number of contributors to Bitcoin ABC keeps growing, which
is encouraging. At this stage, a heartfelt thanks to all who
volunteer their time and effort on this project.</p>

<p>I don't want to call out anyone individually, but if you're
interested you can of course see the contributions to the
project coming in at <a href="https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org">https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org</a>.</p>

<p>ABC is using Phabricator as its main developer site.
Phabricator is a nice (open source) solution for managing
projects, with good code review and workflow features.</p>

<p>We are using the Github repository at the moment to push out
finished code (releases).</p>

<h2>Gearing up for 0.14.3 release</h2>

<p>In the upcoming release, we will roll out better branding
and client identification for ABC, something that several
users had been asking for.
Awesome work by the designer of the logo, if you ask me.</p>

<p>There are some changes related to the transaction signing -
now ABC produces replay-protected transactions by default
when the fork is active.</p>

<p>The release will also include a bugfix for a crash that
could happen occasionally, and did happen to some users.
Let's hope as we get more eyes reviewing code changes, such
things will not re-occur.</p>

<h2>Description of the ABC release process</h2>

<p>Mengerian and I had a constructive session adapting the
document which describes the release process.
This document is still in review at this time (<a href="https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org/D335">https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org/D335</a>).
I post the link here because some people are wondering
about the process ABC follows to release its software.</p>

<p>I would caution that the processes are still very young
and are going to evolve. And there is still a lot of
documentation to adapt, but Mengerian has been doing
fantastic work on getting it into shape.</p>

<h2>Preliminary look at larger blocks with ABC</h2>

<p>One question that had been on my mind was:</p>

<p>How big blocks can ABC handle without running into
some limitation?</p>

<p>This question had been particularly nagging on my
mind since we had an outstanding issue with a test
which seemed limited to 16MB blocks.</p>

<p>That turned out to be trivial to fix (the test simply
needs to be generalized a bit more).</p>

<p>The next obvious target is 32MB.</p>

<p>Since MAX_PROTOCOL_MESSAGE_LENGTH is set to 32MB,
we would expect to be able to produce blocks of almost
that size.</p>

<p>And this is true - the test we have now generates blocks
of exactly the size requested and so we can easily turn
it up to generate a 32MB block. But of course there will
be some overhead to wrap that block data into a peer-to-peer
protocol message.
As the test did not consider this overhead, it will fail
when attempting to process a 32MB block.</p>

<p>So, raise MAX_PROTOCOL_MESSAGE_LENGTH? Yes.</p>

<p>Then I tried going to larger blocks. 64 MB?</p>

<p>No. One runs into another limit at around 33554432 bytes.
Where does this strange number of ~33,5MB come from?
It is of course 32 * 1024 * 1024 bytes, and is another
limit encoded in the software (MAX_SIZE in serialize.h).</p>

<p>Can it be raised? Yes, of course. Bitcoin Unlimited for
example has raised this to 256MB .</p>

<p>Let us be bold and try doing the same - raising both
MAX_PROTOCOL_MESSAGE_LENGTH and MAX_SIZE .</p>

<p>This I did (both to a very large number around 256MB).
That should be enough to attempt really large blocks.</p>

<p>I then ran the test with increasing block size by
1MB at each step.</p>

<p>I got up to processing a 134MB block correctly.
On the next block my bitcoind process exited with
a memory allocation error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Out of memory. Terminating.
</code></pre>

<p>I think my machine has adequate memory, so I have
to resume this investigation.</p>

<p>But initial results from this test are very
encouraging.</p>

<p>As others have reported in the past, there is
massive potential to scale the blocksize dormant
in Satoshi's client.</p>

<h1>Weekly musing #14 - Preparations for the fork</h1>

<h2>bitcoinforks.org DNS seeds for ABC</h2>

<p>Bitcoinforks.org has set up DNS seeds for ABC on</p>

<pre><code>seed-abc.bitcoinforks.org
testnet-seed-abc.bitcoinforks.org
</code></pre>

<p>A simple Python-based seeder software for this is being developed.
The coming weeks will show if this is adequate, and can be released,
or if we have to revert to a modified version of the popular
seeder code by Pieter Wuille.</p>

<h2>Investigations on moving ABC to C++14</h2>

<p>An interesting suggestion was made in ABC the development
forum, to move to C++14 as minimum required language standard.</p>

<p>This has some wide-reaching implications which we still need to
research a bit (some Travis tests have already been conducted on a
dedicated branch).</p>

<p>Despite being 3 years old, C++14 has only recently seen built-in
support by major distributions. For example, you would need Debian 9 or
Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety) or later for compilation to work out of the box.</p>

<p>On older releases, you may need to obtain packages from
channels other than the stable release one.</p>

<p>It is possible to get the Linux build working with C++ on Travis Trusty
by providing the right incantations to install an extra
gcc6 package built for this purpose.</p>

<p>However, the cross-compilation builds for other platforms
make use of other compiler packages which do not support C++14
in their present form, and will need to be updated too.
More research is needed to see if Travis provides suitable
packages, or if one would have to build them oneself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Travis does not support Ubuntu Yakkety yet
(not even Xenial is formally supported, with no firm roadmap).
Maybe ABC has to move to a different system for its CI, if
it wants recent compilers.</p>

<p>The gitian build, which uses Ubuntu Trusty, will also be
affected by a move to C++14.
Some major adaptations will likely be necessary to get
a Yakkety or Debian 9 gitian build environment working right.</p>

<p>As you can see, the names of the build products are still using just 'bitcoin' .
To avoid confusion, maybe it is better to rename them to 'bitcoinabc' in future.</p>

<p>Although I had set up my gitian build environment on a fast native machine (not a virtual machine), I was surprised at how long the build actually took.
It was still a multi-hour process to get all binaries out, but building natively made a big difference compared to my previous gitian builds for BU.</p>

<p>I came across a couple of snags following the "official" gitian build instructions. At a later stage I will make a separate post about how to configure
Gitian natively and using LXC, as that is not well described.  The last obstacle was my machine's firewall (isn't it always <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /> )</p>

<h2>Code comparison to Core 0.14.1</h2>

<p>In order to make it easier for interested persons to review the ABC diff, I created a reformatted branch of the original Core code on which ABC was developed.
Only the files that ABC also modified have been reformatted, to eliminate some of the difference between the old and new (ABC) code that is just due to formatting.</p>

<p>Further instructions on this can be found in the /r/bitcoinabc subreddit in this post:</p>

<p>https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinABC/comments/6kownu/comparing_the_abc_code_to_core/</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>There are some small cleanups to make to improve the ABC release for beta testing.</p>

<p>I plan to have look at some of those during the coming week:</p>

<ul>
<li>improved debug messages and RPC output related to UAHF fork</li>
<li>resolve as many FIXME's as possible</li>
<li>revisit test plan and check with requirements what is still outstanding in terms of tests</li>
</ul>


<p>Certainly, some more intensive big-block tests should be added to the regression test suite.</p>

<p>And hopefully public testing will not raise any serious bugs.</p>

<p>There are some platforms like ARM for which the Gitian builds have produced binaries, but
we have not yet tested them at all (often due to lack of test platforms).</p>

<p>This is something where we will depend on feedback from users in the short term.</p>

<h1>Weekly musing #12 - Gearing up for release</h1>

<h2>Final touches on ABC</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoinabc/bitcoinabc">Bitcoin ABC</a> is a modified version of Bitcoin Core with a user-configurable
maximum blocksize, i.e. an Adjustable Blocksize Cap (hence "ABC").</p>

<p>It is based on Core 0.14.1, and implements the <a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-UAHF/spec/uahf-technical-spec.md">UAHF specification</a>.
The source code and development can be found at https://reviews.bitcoinabc.org .</p>

<p>We've been very busy getting this to near release so far.
There are a few minor finishing touches remaining on the code, but it's almost feature complete.</p>

<p>In a follow-up post I'd like to do a walk-through post of the changes at some stage, but this requires reformatting the baseline (the Core 0.14.1 commit where ABC branched off) so that we can cleanly compare what was built on top.</p>

<p>The difference looks bigger than it really is in terms of code changes, because nearly the entire codebase has been put through clang-format to clean up the source code.
This obscures the significant functional changes to an extent.
A <code>git diff --stat</code> shows 508 changed files so far - that includes files that were newly added (e.g. ABC tests) and files that were removed (e.g. those related purely to SegWit).</p>

<p>Re-formatting the baseline 0.14.1 with the same style rules to get a clean comparison requires some touch-ups.
This is because some sections in ABC were protected from clang-format's modifications.
There are also manual formatting actions to improve layouting of comments, although these are easy to ignore.
Overall, there were 337 commits since development on top of Core commit 964a185cc began.</p>

<p>It could be helpful to mark the functional changes related to UAHF with their respective requirements.</p>

<h2>Test framework issues</h2>

<p>We have identified what is likely an issue with the Python test framework's handling of peer messages.</p>

<p>During tests with large blocks, the test framework's mininode may run into buffering problems on the received data, which often leads to test failure.
This only seems to happen towards the end of one big-block test at the moment, and there is a workaround to reduces the chance of this happening.</p>

<p>However, it is very likely that we need to re-work the test framework's message buffering and processing if we want to be able to do very-large-block tests.</p>

<p>Perhaps this played a role in previous tests where we struggled to test &gt; 16MB blocks.</p>

<p>On testnet3, the forked client has produced blocks over 15MB already which were well received by its peers.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC</h2>

<p>Work is progressing towards the Bitcoin ABC implementation.
Already it was able to digest blocks slightly larger than 8MB on BU's no-limits testnet.
In regression tests, sizes up to 16MB have not posed a problem.</p>

<p>Scaling Bitcoin Core may not be as simple as adjusting a single constant, but ABC proves it can be done.</p>

<h2>UAHF</h2>

<p>The release of the UAHF contingency plan [3] and the accompanying technical specification [4] marked a decisive answer to the threat posed to Bitcoin's security by BIP-148 (UASF).</p>

<p>ABC adaptations for the counter HF to the upcoming UASF are in an advanced stage and expected to be ready for validation soon.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>BU is working on a UAHF-compatible specification [5]. It is provisionally called 'BUIP-HF'.
Development is going to be channeled through the 'buip-hf' branch on my Github repository,
from where I will feed Pull Requests back to BU.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/ftrader-bitcoinunlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/buip-hf/doc/buip-hf.md">guidance document</a> has been created for contributing BU developers.</p>

<p>Preparations are also underway for another point release of BU prior to a major release later this year which should bring most of the 'dev' branch changes over to 'release'.</p>

<h2>BTCfork MVF</h2>

<p>I'm considering adapting the SegWit trigger condition of the MVF's to take into account the planned SegWit2x activation conditions (which seem to have swung in favor of BIP-91 now).
Still to be decided, but my stance is unchanged - in the event of SegWit activating on the main chain, there should be a spin-off to provide a SegWit-free alternative.
This could be UAHF, but since that is planned to activate some hours after UASF, it could make sense to activate an earlier spin-off at the same time as UASF.</p>

<h1>Weekly musing #10 - Learning the ABC's</h1>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC</h2>

<p>Bitcoin ABC - short for Adjustable Blocksize Cap , is a big-block capable
client based on Core 0.14.1 that is progressing in development and gaining
more contributors and code reviewers.</p>

<p>Parts of the main functionality (being able to adjust the block size cap through a
configuration option) have now been implemented for the command line client.
Others remain to be added, for example being able to display its accepted block size
limit in the well-known /EBx/ format used by BU and Classic.</p>

<p>A version of ABC should be out for testing in the next few weeks!</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>A specification for a hard fork release along the lines of BUIP 055 is taking shape.
I have had the pleasure of collaborating with various developers and stakeholders
in drafting this, and it is nearing completion.</p>

<p>Many refinements have been made over BUIP 055.</p>

<p>For example, there is provision for bi-drectional replay protection, and protection
against re-organization by the legacy chain.</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>With a wide variety of projects rallying around the idea of a near-term HF,
elements of BTCfork's MVF may come in useful for implementors of other clients.</p>

<p>In particular, clients targeted at end users might benefit from the automatic wallet
backup functionality written by redmarlen (a fellow BU developer too).
This could be integrated into other fork clients quiet easily.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>Voting is over, and the results for this round of BUIPs and new member applications is in.
Congratulations to the new members!
The new system was quite pleasant to use. I hope it will continue to get improvements.
One that most of us would probably like is batched voting, so one doesn't have to sign for every issue individually.</p>

<p>To those applicants who did not get in this time, I hope you will apply again and participate in the meantime!
Some clearly did not make it in because existing members abstained or voted in low numbers, which troubles me a little.
I think 21/49 voter turnout is not that great - certainly room for improvement.</p>

<h3>Improvement Proposals</h3>

<p>On the BUIP side, I am happy that BU has passed the BUIP026 to offer <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip026-passed-bounties-for-software-exploits.1970/">bounties for exploitable bugs</a>.</p>

<p>CompactBlocks were accepted by a nice majority, so they will become reality in BU!
This should lead to bandwidth savings all around.
With BU's network code undergoing big refactorings on the development branch, it will be a bit of a challenge to develop, but nothing insurmountable. Existing tests from Core and XT can hopefully be re-used with minor adaptations.</p>

<p>I'm also excited about BUIP052 - this should get the project a separate Continuous Integration service for daily tests of the whole test suite. BU contributor awemany has been investigating fuzz testing, which would be a good thing to include on such daily tests.</p>

<p>A bit disappointing is that BUIP053 and BUIP054 did not reach quorum, and had to be closed despite quite solid majorities in favor of these proposals. It was just not enough this time around.</p>

<p>BUIP053 (Tweakable DoS responses) in particular is one I had high hopes for in terms of moving us away from a relatively static and inflexible scoring/banning design, towards something that places more power in the hands of users and reduces the impact of (potentially bad) developer decisions.</p>

<p>Also great news is that both BUIP055 (hard fork in near future) and BUIP056 (support-threshold triggered block size increases) were passed. The first one indicates that membership clearly recognizes the urgent need to act in offering a definite hard fork to the market, especially in light of the threat of UASF.
BUIP056 appears a good way to reach consensus within the EB signaling framework pioneered by BU but which is being adopted by other clients such as Classic and hopefully more in future.</p>

<p>BUIP057 (BIP135 support) could be useful for future upgrade deployments, due to its flexibility in configuring activation thresholds and grace periods for proposed forking changes (whether soft or hard).</p>

<h3>Nolnet reboot</h3>

<p>Initial testing on BU's rebooted Nolnet (no-limits testnet) suggests there could still be issues related to unwanted node banning during block header synchronisation.</p>

<p>But the rebooted parameters of the network will ensure that Nolnet addresses are different from ordinary Bitcoin addresses, and so avoid possible mistakes that could result in some financial loss.
Nolnet will also reset to minimum difficulty now, so that locking out testers by raising the difficulty to a very high value will not be possible so easily (at least, not for long periods).</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>The new Nolnet settings need to be integrated into MVFs, as I plan to have the MVF's be able to participate in fork tests, also w.r.t. BUIP055.</p>

<p>I found an embarrasing bit shifting bug in the replay protection code. Thanks go to Tom Harding for inspiring me to look over it again.
Funny how one can get inspired to look carefully at one's code when someone else is interested in it too <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>Another small change that seemed prudent, was to bypass the MVF's adjusted difficulty retargeting code if the user specified that the difficulty was not to be reset at the fork activation. So now, if diffdrop=1, only the old difficulty code path is used.
I had not really thought much about minority forks which want to keep the difficulty the same, but if there are such, then it's better to carry on running the existing code.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC</h2>

<p>Still working on the ABC functionality - have been mostly reviewing changes by the project lead.</p>
