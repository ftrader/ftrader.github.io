<h1>Weekly musing #14 - Preparations for the fork</h1>

<h2>bitcoinforks.org DNS seeds for ABC</h2>

<p>Bitcoinforks.org has set up DNS seeds for ABC on</p>

<pre><code>seed-abc.bitcoinforks.org
testnet-seed-abc.bitcoinforks.org
</code></pre>

<p>A simple Python-based seeder software for this is being developed.
The coming weeks will show if this is adequate, and can be released,
or if we have to revert to a modified version of the popular
seeder code by Pieter Wuille.</p>

<h2>Investigations on moving ABC to C++14</h2>

<p>An interesting suggestion was made in ABC the development
forum, to move to C++14 as minimum required language standard.</p>

<p>This has some wide-reaching implications which we still need to
research a bit (some Travis tests have already been conducted on a
dedicated branch).</p>

<p>Despite being 3 years old, C++14 has only recently seen built-in
support by major distributions. For example, you would need Debian 9 or
Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety) or later for compilation to work out of the box.</p>

<p>On older releases, you may need to obtain packages from
channels other than the stable release one.</p>

<p>It is possible to get the Linux build working with C++ on Travis Trusty
by providing the right incantations to install an extra
gcc6 package built for this purpose.</p>

<p>However, the cross-compilation builds for other platforms
make use of other compiler packages which do not support C++14
in their present form, and will need to be updated too.
More research is needed to see if Travis provides suitable
packages, or if one would have to build them oneself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Travis does not support Ubuntu Yakkety yet
(not even Xenial is formally supported, with no firm roadmap).
Maybe ABC has to move to a different system for its CI, if
it wants recent compilers.</p>

<p>The gitian build, which uses Ubuntu Trusty, will also be
affected by a move to C++14.
Some major adaptations will likely be necessary to get
a Yakkety or Debian 9 gitian build environment working right.</p>
