<h1>Weekly musing #20 - Let the market speak</h1>

<h2>Bitcoin Cash</h2>

<p>It's inspiring to see how well Bitcoin Cash has done in this last week.</p>

<p>The market has certainly run with it.</p>

<p>It's unclear whether the temporary spike in transactions that led to the mining of a nearly 8MB block was an attempt to attack the network, or simply a test of transaction capacity.
It certainly was not a scheduled test by any of the main implementations, so naturally it put everyone on alert.</p>

<p>Regardless of intent, it showed the network was more than capable of absorbing such loads, and may have contributed to increasing confidence among users and those watching on the sidelines.</p>

<p>If it was intended as an attack, it's safe to say it backfired spectacularly.</p>

<p>Price rises brought parity in terms of mining profitability with the legacy chain.</p>

<p>A further difficulty reduction by about 40 percent boosted that profitability advantage (at least momentarily) to upwards of 150%.
Miners have certainly paid attention, with large new pools joining to mine the chain.</p>

<p>All signs point to continued support and growth.
We shall need to let the market speak, and listen carefully to what it says.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC</h2>

<p>I believe we need to open the public discussion to introduce a separate address scheme in this coming week.</p>

<p>Reproducing the import-related wallet issues has proved difficult, and work is still ongoing.</p>
