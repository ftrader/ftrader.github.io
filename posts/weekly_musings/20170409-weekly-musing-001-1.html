<h1>Welcome to freetrader's weekly musings (new)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've decided to write up a little weekly retrospective.
My goal is to share some thoughts, notes and tips for those
who wish to delve into Bitcoin development or support
the current efforts of the community to address the
on-chain scaling problems.</p>

<p>Since this is the first of these episodes, I'll touch on
some other topics as well which I think might interest
some of you who've been following things in the 'forking'
realm.</p>

<h2>What's happening with BTCfork?</h2>

<p>I must say I've neglected BTCfork a little in the
last two months while devoting more time to BU.
My last stint on BTCfork was to get Travis CI properly
working on the project's MVF repos, which it is now,
and starting to set up automated consistency checks for
the requirements and design specifications (which should
later be extended to cover the code as well - more about
this later).</p>

<p>Travis CI turned out to be quite easy to set up, based
on the good work of the base projects (Bitcoin Unlimited
and Core). The only snag to watch out for when setting
up Travis on a Bitcoin fork project is that one will
need to contact Travis support to allow the project,
because such projects are automatically identified as
doing Bitcoin mining (during their automated tests).
Obviously CI providers don't want their resources to
be used up by people doing Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>Travis support staff were awesome and resolved the
issue right away. I can only recommend the service to
anyone.</p>

<p>The next step in MVF-BU will be to rebase on latest
BU release. I am waiting for a next regular release
(more bugfixes after the recent exploit hotfixes).</p>

<h2>Why not fork right now?!</h2>

<p>As the recent black hat exploits against BU 1.0.1 version
showed, bugs are easily introduced, and there are
no doubt sleeping ones that we do not know about
yet, but attackers might.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is necessary that we upgrade MVF-BU to
the most recent BU patches, otherwise it can be
trivially attacked right now.
I'll probably end up manually rebasing the MVF changes on
latest BU instead of trying to merge from upstream,
as when I looked at the merge set it was more than
400 files with many collisions.</p>

<p>Secondly, there's still quite a bit of work to
be done on the MVF regarding clean network separation.</p>

<p>It may well be that the big-blocks front (BU, Classic, XT,
probably others too like <a href="https://github.com/whitslack/bitcoin-infinity">Infinity</a>)
soon gets enough miner support for a majority fork.</p>

<p>In that case, I am most likely going to resume my
work on BTCfork only after assisting wherever I can
with BU. They have done a great job at attracting
more support from the broad community, and they are
really putting a lot of effort into improving the
quality of their code - a process which I'm grateful
and happy to be able to participate in.</p>

<h2>Code quality improvements in Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>I'm going to mention a few things I've seen that
give me reason to be very optimistic about code
quality in BU and neighboring projects.</p>

<p>Firstly, BU has embarked on a mission of cleaning
up the C++ code by enforcing automated style checks,
using clang-format and some custom tools to
sensibly arrange comments.</p>

<p>This is being trial-run on the files which have
been introduced by BU, and will probably be
either rolled out incrementally as further files
are modified, or applied to the whole codebase
in a 'flag day' run.</p>

<p>Either way, a long-hoped dream of developers
will come true as the code comes out looking
much more readable, and can be kept that way
by the CI checks and more tools provided to developers.</p>

<p>BU lead dev Andrew Stone has also declared that
commented code sections introduced by BU can
be cleanup up now. This process has started in
earnest <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, BU is in the process of examining the
code - both its own additions and the existing
base - for more lurking bugs.
I can't reveal much more, but to say that I'm
satisfied that the project is fully aware of
good practice and starting to implement it
carefully.</p>

<p>This also applies to code reviews on Github.</p>

<p>I spent several hours reviewing PRs in BU,
and I'm very happy to see other devs like
Tom Zander assist with excellent code review inputs.</p>

<p>In some cases, developers have found that
automated testing is very difficult to apply to
their change using the existing frameworks for
unit tests and 'qa' (regression) tests.</p>

<p>A proposal would be that rather than silently merging
PRs which are affected by this "difficulty to test",
the developers should try to explain (on Github) why
the code changes are not readily testable by the
existing automated frameworks. This would open the
discussion and examination. In some cases, maybe
a better solution could be found either by adapting
the change, or by enhancing a framework.</p>

<p>If there is absolutely no direct solution, then
there is a still a remaining option to test such
changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>write up a manual test script which a tester can perform.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not very unusual in legacy applications which
were not developed from the ground up with automated
testing in mind.</p>

<p>For example, the bitcoin-qt graphical user interface
(GUI) is not automatically tested at all.
It would be very helpful if there were documented
test procedures for such areas where manual testing
is still the only solution.</p>

<p>Right now, BU has started using Github PR threads
to record when we do manual test steps and what
results are obtained by reviewers/testers who
try to verify by testing.
But long-term, this is also not optimal, because
the test knowledge remains buried in some PRs and
will be difficult to find again.</p>

<p>Much better will be if projects can start to
keep manual test procedures in version control
together with the code, for example in a
<code>doc/manual_tests</code> folder.</p>

<p>The test procedures need to be specific enough
for the most part so that a tester can treat the
software as a black box - just set it up as
instructed, perform the listed steps and check
for some expected outputs.</p>

<p>On previous projects I worked on, such manual tests
were automated over time as test frameworks became
mature enough.</p>

<p>A side benefit of committing test procedures and
test results to a repository is that the evidence
of testing becomes public.</p>

<p>It strikes me as obvious that a lot of testing is
done on the Bitcoin codebase, but much of it is not
adequately (publicly) recorded, and thus becomes
'lost' to others. In fact, others may even doubt that
it has taken place.
And they should doubt that is has been
tested adequately <em>and correctly</em> if the evidence is
not public.</p>

<h3>Improving Python code quality</h3>

<p>There is quite a bit of Python code in the client.
In BU it is ~100 files, with about 11,5 KLOC in the
<code>qa/</code> folder alone. Most of this code has not been
run through the standard tools used to keep Python
code clean, like <code>flake8</code> and <code>pylint</code>.
Or if it has, it was a long time ago, because it
has deteriorated. It would be helpful to clean all
that code up too, not just the C++ code.</p>

<p>Such Python cleanup is also quite easy to put in
automated tools and scripts to help developers.
Style checks can be enforced through CI as well.</p>

<p>As an example of cleanup, I have <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/pull/248">applied some basic tools</a>
on a test which was modified by Bitcoin Classic.</p>

<p>I am planning to write a helper script which will
make it easier to run such cleanup on all Python scripts.</p>

<h2>On improving specifications in Bitcoin, part 1</h2>

<p>Before writing software, I prefer to think about the
problem first, and come up with a set of requirements,
and design changes. In my experience, the time invested
in this more than pays for itself.</p>

<p>Specification can be done even when faced with a legacy
application to which you intend to make incremental changes.
An example would be the set of 'forking' changes made in
the MVFs to their baseline clients (BU and Core).</p>

<p>In the Bitcoin world, currently we are used to BIPs
and BUIPs providing specifications of changes.</p>

<p>So far, these specifications are relatively informal,
if we look at them from an engineering point of view.
They currently span a gamut of levels without clear
layering. You will find bits of C++ code in BIPs,
when pseudocode would be more useful and
intelligible to readers who are not necessarily
C++ programmers.</p>

<p>Good specifications must cover several levels, from the
birds-eye view of the end user, to the software
design decisions.
It is not practical to expect all of this from a
single document like a BIP.</p>

<p>But these different levels of specification are needed
for various parties to easily obtain and digest the
information they need about working with and maintaining
the system. So we can see that the Bitcoin project has
quite a large gap to fill in addressing the need for
a good specification.</p>

<p>Good requirements <a href="#footnote2">[2]</a> in particular help everyone to:</p>

<ul>
<li>record and identify what is the expected behavior of the system</li>
<li>assess whether its actual behavior is in line with expectation, or whether the system needs corrections or enhancement</li>
<li>reduce communicative friction when talking about particular aspects of its behavior</li>
</ul>


<p>Requirements should be clear and identifiable.
Where necessary, they can introduce special, well-defined
terms and it is better if they use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">formal language</a> <a href="#footnote3">[3]</a> to
rule out ambiguity.</p>

<p>They need to be easily referenced by other documents
related to a system, e.g. design documents, test documents,
even bug reports.</p>

<p>Usually, high-level requirements are translated into
low-level requirements (e.g. user requirements are
refined into system requirement, which in turn can be
refined into even lower-level software requirements).</p>

<p>The software requirements in turn are what drives
the design of the software, which leads to
implemented code.</p>

<p>If you want to have reasonable assurance that the
code has been implemented to meet the requirements,
it helps to be able to trace the work done - from
the requirements, through the design, to the actual
code code - and back. This traceability helps with
controlling quality, because it makes it easier to
check that the code covers the features it is supposed
to, and does not do things for which no-one asked.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, maintaining software is a
difficult and expensive task whose effort can grow
substantially as the size of the codebase increases.
Nobody wants to maintain features that no-one uses.</p>

<p>In the BTCfork context I decided right away that we
want to have a better requirements and design specification.
This requires a bit of tooling to ensure consistency
between the requirements and design, and what ends up in
the code.
I've begun to write such a tool, <a href="https://github.com/ftrader/spec_checker.git">spec_checker</a>
which can cross-check the textual requirements and design
documents automatically when changes are made to them.</p>

<p>In conjunction with a CI system, this tool can be used
to report when changes are made that leave the specification
(and later: the software too) in an inconsistent state.</p>

<p>To see an example of its usage in conjunction with Travis,
you can look at how it is enabled in <a href="https://github.com/ftrader/bitcoinfork-collaborative-spec/commit/84e7e124306781cb820676d61e8ad809b305caa3">this commit</a>
on the <code>bitcoinfork-collaborative-spec</code> repo.</p>

<p>Of course, BTCfork's MVF specifications are still
incomplete, and the tool does not yet check whether
the requirements are properly traced down to the
code level.</p>

<p>It's a first step in that direction - more steps are needed.
This will be the first of many 'instalments' on the topic
of specifications, what we can improve in Bitcoin,
and how we can get to a proper specification of the
protocol - a huge topic and endeavour for sure.
But it can be done.</p>
