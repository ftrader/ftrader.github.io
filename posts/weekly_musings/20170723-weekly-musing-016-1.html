<h1>Weekly musing #16 - Preparing for Bitcoin network upgrade</h1>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC issues release 0.14.4</h2>

<p>Release 0.14.4 has been issued by Bitcoin ABC this week.</p>

<p>With the fork nearing, minor fixes and improvements are
still being made.</p>

<p>While the precise changes for the next version of Bitcoin ABC
(0.14.5) are still not finalized, it is thought that it
will further strengthen the replay protection, in particular
to address concerns about replayability of legacy Bitcoin
transactions on the UAHF fork chain.</p>

<p>A big thank you is deserved at this point to all Bitcoin
users who have been supportive of the UAHF planned upgrade of
network capacity.</p>

<p>I am encouraged by generous offers of support, with users
offering their personal computing platforms to perform
tests and builds.</p>

<p>With this sort of spirit of cooperation , Bitcoin ABC's
future looks bright.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited prepares to issue UAHF-compatible release</h2>

<p>A special BU edition intended to bring UAHF compatibility is
nearing completion.</p>

<p>It looks like this is well on track for release prior to the
fork date.</p>

<h2>Classic, XT announce intention to issue UAHF versions</h2>

<p>Both the Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT project lead
developers have announced that they will prepare Bitcoin
Cash (UAHF) compatible releases.</p>

<p>While no firm dates have been given, it seems there
is a good chance that these clients may be issuing releases
prior to the fork, or at latest very shortly after.</p>

<p>Assuming they achieve their release goals, this would bring
the total number of UAHF compatible clients so far up to four
- more than originally anticipated.</p>

<h2>Market support for Bitcoin Cash</h2>

<p>This week, ViaBTC introduced support for trading and
mining Bitcoin Cash (their symbol: BCC), which has triggered
a cascade of market interest.</p>

<p>There are of course a lot of questions from Bitcoin holders
who are finding out that on August 1 2017, at 12:20:00pm UTC,
Bitcoin will split and they will own both BTC and BCC.</p>

<p>This will be a monumental event. Early trading figures
on ViaBTC's platform suggest that there is keen interest,
both from those looking to acquire Bitcoin Cash, and those
wanting to make sure they are able to sell theirs.</p>

<p>It is almost certain that Bitcoin Cash, with its significant
on-chain scaling potential and a huge community of pre-existing
holders, will find adequate mining support to get off to
a good start, and will finally answer the question whether
the market wants to use Satoshi's invention without the artificially
low block size limit of 1MB.</p>

<p>Exciting times for Bitcoin!</p>
