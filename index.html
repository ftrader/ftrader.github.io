<h1>Weekly musing #10 - Learning the ABC's</h1>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC</h2>

<p>Bitcoin ABC - short for Adjustable Blocksize Cap , is a big-block capable
client based on Core 0.14.1 that is progressing in development and gaining
more contributors and code reviewers.</p>

<p>Parts of the main functionality (being able to adjust the block size cap through a
configuration option) have now been implemented for the command line client.
Others remain to be added, for example being able to display its accepted block size
limit in the well-known /EBx/ format used by BU and Classic.</p>

<p>A version of ABC should be out for testing in the next few weeks!</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>A specification for a hard fork release along the lines of BUIP 055 is taking shape.
I have had the pleasure of collaborating with various developers and stakeholders
in drafting this, and it is nearing completion.</p>

<p>Many refinements have been made over BUIP 055.</p>

<p>For example, there is provision for bi-drectional replay protection, and protection
against re-organization by the legacy chain.</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>With a wide variety of projects rallying around the idea of a near-term HF,
elements of BTCfork's MVF may come in useful for implementors of other clients.</p>

<p>In particular, clients targeted at end users might benefit from the automatic wallet
backup functionality written by redmarlen (a fellow BU developer too).
This could be integrated into other fork clients quiet easily.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>Voting is over, and the results for this round of BUIPs and new member applications is in.
Congratulations to the new members!
The new system was quite pleasant to use. I hope it will continue to get improvements.
One that most of us would probably like is batched voting, so one doesn't have to sign for every issue individually.</p>

<p>To those applicants who did not get in this time, I hope you will apply again and participate in the meantime!
Some clearly did not make it in because existing members abstained or voted in low numbers, which troubles me a little.
I think 21/49 voter turnout is not that great - certainly room for improvement.</p>

<h3>Improvement Proposals</h3>

<p>On the BUIP side, I am happy that BU has passed the BUIP026 to offer <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip026-passed-bounties-for-software-exploits.1970/">bounties for exploitable bugs</a>.</p>

<p>CompactBlocks were accepted by a nice majority, so they will become reality in BU!
This should lead to bandwidth savings all around.
With BU's network code undergoing big refactorings on the development branch, it will be a bit of a challenge to develop, but nothing insurmountable. Existing tests from Core and XT can hopefully be re-used with minor adaptations.</p>

<p>I'm also excited about BUIP052 - this should get the project a separate Continuous Integration service for daily tests of the whole test suite. BU contributor awemany has been investigating fuzz testing, which would be a good thing to include on such daily tests.</p>

<p>A bit disappointing is that BUIP053 and BUIP054 did not reach quorum, and had to be closed despite quite solid majorities in favor of these proposals. It was just not enough this time around.</p>

<p>BUIP053 (Tweakable DoS responses) in particular is one I had high hopes for in terms of moving us away from a relatively static and inflexible scoring/banning design, towards something that places more power in the hands of users and reduces the impact of (potentially bad) developer decisions.</p>

<p>Also great news is that both BUIP055 (hard fork in near future) and BUIP056 (support-threshold triggered block size increases) were passed. The first one indicates that membership clearly recognizes the urgent need to act in offering a definite hard fork to the market, especially in light of the threat of UASF.
BUIP056 appears a good way to reach consensus within the EB signaling framework pioneered by BU but which is being adopted by other clients such as Classic and hopefully more in future.</p>

<p>BUIP057 (BIP135 support) could be useful for future upgrade deployments, due to its flexibility in configuring activation thresholds and grace periods for proposed forking changes (whether soft or hard).</p>

<h3>Nolnet reboot</h3>

<p>Initial testing on BU's rebooted Nolnet (no-limits testnet) suggests there could still be issues related to unwanted node banning during block header synchronisation.</p>

<p>But the rebooted parameters of the network will ensure that Nolnet addresses are different from ordinary Bitcoin addresses, and so avoid possible mistakes that could result in some financial loss.
Nolnet will also reset to minimum difficulty now, so that locking out testers by raising the difficulty to a very high value will not be possible so easily (at least, not for long periods).</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>The new Nolnet settings need to be integrated into MVFs, as I plan to have the MVF's be able to participate in fork tests, also w.r.t. BUIP055.</p>

<p>I found an embarrasing bit shifting bug in the replay protection code. Thanks go to Tom Harding for inspiring me to look over it again.
Funny how one can get inspired to look carefully at one's code when someone else is interested in it too <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>Another small change that seemed prudent, was to bypass the MVF's adjusted difficulty retargeting code if the user specified that the difficulty was not to be reset at the fork activation. So now, if diffdrop=1, only the old difficulty code path is used.
I had not really thought much about minority forks which want to keep the difficulty the same, but if there are such, then it's better to carry on running the existing code.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC</h2>

<p>Still working on the ABC functionality - have been mostly reviewing changes by the project lead.</p>

<h1>Weekly musing #8 - Keep calm and fork</h1>

<table class="img align-right"><caption>Fork at Vevey, Lake Geneva</caption><tr><td><a href="./images/vevey-2104986_540.jpg"><img src="./images/vevey-2104986_540.jpg" width="540" height="720" alt="Fork at Vevey, Lake Geneva" class="img" /></a></td></tr></table>


<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>A rebase on very recent BU <code>dev</code> branch has been completed.</p>

<p>I learned the painful lesson that it is much easier just to merge in the changes from upstream as opposed to actually rebasing (in Git's sense) all the MVF work, which would necessitate a forced push on MVF-BU's <code>master</code> (default) branch. That would be disruptive to those who have checkouts of MVF-BU (not many, I suppose, but it would be bad practice).</p>

<p>Thinking about requirements for a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/btcfork/comments/6cn7ye/the_silbert_accord_and_its_implications/">UASF counter-fork</a> to UASF will see me adding a few requirements to the MVFs.</p>

<p>One of them is probably time-based forking - in order to fork exactly on an unknown block height which corresponds to the median time activation criterion of BIP148 or similar proposals. This would make MVFs capable of forking on either block height OR a chosen time, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>One could set the block height to a very high value if one did not want to use it, to let the time-based forking take precedence.</p>

<p>I've held off on implementing time-based forking up to now since it comes with a few more complications.
The client cannot tell for certain when the final pre-fork block has been received, and this makes things like changing to the new consensus rules and performing wallet backups harder. But it seems that flag day forks like UASF require a forking trigger in MVF to be able to fork at exactly the same time, so as to create the least difference between the fork blockchain and the legacy chain.</p>

<p>A rebase of MVF-Core is still outstanding. The objective will be to rebase on Core 0.14 minus SegWit/RBF, but with Adjustable Blocksize Cap.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>Apart from reviews and minor fixes to some extended tests, I've uploaded my eligible BUIPs for the coming voting round.</p>

<p>I am keen to see the new voting system in action, although it is becoming clear that it will need a bit of handholding by its creator for the first session. This is of course normal. So far, I like what I've seen!
There are some areas that may need small improvement in future, e.g. in management of unpublished proposals, and dealing with users who have lost their keys and need to revoke them. The latter part may be a bit tricky! I would recommend BU users to always keep a separate PGP key for BU signing purposes, so that they could use that to revoke the Bitcoin key in a pinch.</p>

<h1>Weekly musing #7 - User Activated System Failure?</h1>

<p>It will be interesting to watch as UASF activates on August 1.</p>

<p>Bitcoin should be a robust protocol on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8">layers 8 and above</a> <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>Hopefully kyuupichan's port of the Classic parameter fixes makes it into BU soon.
After reviewing it, I like it a lot - the changes should make BU safer to operate.
It did show however, that a single reviewer does not catch everything - I missed a reference to 'Bitcoin Classic'!</p>

<p>As the time approaches for another exciting round of votes in BU, I have added two BUIPs which I feel can help:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip058-dynamic-checkpoints.2135/">BUIP058</a> (dynamic checkpoints)</li>
<li><a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip059-make-sticky-gate-optional-disabled-by-default.2137/">BUIP059</a> (make sticky gate optional)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dynamic checkpoints</h3>

<p>This would offer a general way to address re-org risk when a transition from one blocksize Schelling point to another happens.
Currently of course we face the 1MB barrier, but maybe in the (far?) future we face a 32MB barrier etc.</p>

<p>Eventually, dynamic checkpoints could be created when certain conditions on the chain are met (case in point: when the first &gt;1MB block is generated).</p>

<p>Short term, they could offer some resistance against massive re-orgs caused by an attacker.
One could conceivably add regular (automated) dynamic checkpointing (e.g. every day, replace the most recent dynamic checkpoint with a new block that is at least a week deep).</p>

<h3>Make "sticky gate" optional</h3>

<p>In retrospective, I think BUIP038 may have lost support because it did not offer users the choice of running with the "sticky gate" feature.
It could also have been bad luck / apathy during that particular voting cycle.
Not everyone feels able to vote on such technical issues - this is also part of the problem with increasing complexity - which is what I think may have also killed the counter-proposal, BUIP041.</p>

<p>One thing remains clear: the "sticky gate" was successfully exploited on social media to paint BU in a negative light, using the speculated "median EB attack" which hopes to divide the network by producing a series of larger blocks. Having the feature disabled by default would make BU's "Emergent Consensus" default logic slightly easier to grasp, and would also make it harder to attack in the proposed way.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin-ABC</h2>

<p>I've created the "dirty" implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/ftrader-bitcoinabc/bitcoin-abc/commits/feature/2mb_test-dirty">2MB-capable Core</a>, albeit it does scale block max sigops correctly yet (it allows up to 40K sigops per block instead of scaling at 20K per MB).
It does however pass the existing test suite.</p>

<p>I've not pushed my private ABC branch yet, as there is still work to be done on it.</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>I am planning to rebase on latest BU dev again. It would be good to test out dynamic checkpointing in a feature branch of an up-to-date MVF-BU.</p>

<h3>v1.0.2.0 release (fix for 2nd memory exhaustion incident)</h3>

<p>Another release (1.0.2.0), fixing another Xthin exploitable bug similar to the previous memory exhaustion issue.
Again, the problem and a workaround were quickly identified. Having <code>use-thinblocks=0</code> disables Xthin more effectively since 1.0.1.4 - fortunately that worked and probably protected quite a few nodes. Still, having 1/3 of the BU nodes killed again obviously shakes confidence.</p>

<p>A lot of fixes were brought together for the 1.0.2.0 release, which made it take longer.
Good things take time, but bad code can waste a lot of time. I guess BU is paying the price for changing p2p protocol code without sufficient review and testing in the early days.
While some of the easily exploited holes have now been closed, there are some worries remaining, like the risk of someone producing relatively cheap collisions, or the memory limit while reconstructing thinblocks being perhaps a little higher than needed.</p>

<p>Still, my feeling is BU is getting more robust with each attack. However, recovery was a little more protracted with this one, as it tool longer for the official binaries to be released.
Source code fixes were available in PR form quite early on.</p>

<p>There was however again a percentage of users who probably will not come back to BU because of this incident. Classic seems to have made some small gains (not visible on chart below).</p>

<table class="img"><caption>nodecounter.com recent Bitcoin Unlimited nodes statistics</caption><tr><td><a href="./images/20170514_bu_nodes_nodecounter_recent.png"><img src="./images/20170514_bu_nodes_nodecounter_recent.png" width="1125" height="387" alt="nodecounter.com recent Bitcoin Unlimited nodes statistics" class="img" /></a></td></tr></table>


<p>With the aid of a little script from thezerg, I managed to get my BU gitian build working for this release, and was thus able to sign the 1.0.2.0 checksums.
I think I will need to abandon my gitian build VM though, it seems just to slow compared to others.</p>

<h3>pruning.py problems not local to BU</h3>

<p>After getting such poor pass rates on the pruning test, I executed it on Classic and Core latest builds as well.</p>

<p>On Classic, it went into a loop, which I stopped after several hours.</p>

<p>On Core, it timed out as well. I raised <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10393">Github issue 10393</a> which has yet to receive a response.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>I opened an issue for the <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/557">overly verbose keypool traces</a> in the log file.
These have been bugging myself and others - they often lead to questions whether something is wrong.
I have not decided which debug flag to use for them.</p>

<h3>BUIPs</h3>

<p>There are some interesting coordination-related proposals which have been raised on the forum (in Draft BUIP form):</p>

<ul>
<li>Peter Rizun's <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip055-increase-the-block-size-limit-at-a-fixed-block-height.2103/">BUIP055</a></li>
<li>Tomas van der Wansem's <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/increase-the-block-size-limit-triggered-by-a-support-threshold.2111/">threshold-based BUIP</a> (no number yet)</li>
<li>Sancho Panza's <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buipxxx-add-bip135-support-bip9.2114/">BUIP to add BIP135</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I'm looking forward to the upcoming voting - I will raise BUIP038 too since it did not get quorum the time before last, and I think that it should be put to the vote now that membership and participation have increased. I am undecided on whether to make it into a new BUIP with a toggle to enable the sticky gate instead of just removing it as BUIP038 proposed. If anyone has strong feelings about that, I'd like to hear about them!</p>

<h2>Bitcoin-ABC</h2>

<p>The failing regression tests have been sorted out - ABC is now passing its Travis tests.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/1">Removed SegWit regression tests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/2">Fixed p2p-compactblocks.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/4">Fixed wallet transaction check which failed lots of regtests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/5">Removed leftover bumpfee code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/11">Removed replace-by-fee.py</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/15">Fixed maxuploadtarget.py</a></li>
</ul>


<p>While looking at fixing the failing nulldummy.py test, I <a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/pull/6">considered</a> removing the NULLDUMMY support entirely.
It is a soft-fork which is actually functionally separate from SegWit, but deployed on the same bit!
This is a bit unorthodox, but on the mailing list Johnson Lau defended this with the reason that it would reduce testing effort for SegWit not to handle it as an independent soft-fork.</p>

<p>After raising <a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/issues/3">an issue</a> to decide on the right course of action, I discussed it with deadalnix, who was in favor of retaining it for now.</p>

<p>I have created an ABC branch (on my personal fork repo) where I have executed a more aggressive removal of this currently unused feature and its test. I will be cherry-picking from the mainline ABC repo, trying to keep it clean of features which are not yet present or needed in today's Bitcoin Core, and focusing only on the basic blocksize scaling part.</p>

<p>As part of resolving the failing tests, I did 10 runs of the '-extended' regression test suite, excluding the 'pruning' test which takes too long.
The results were interesting - not all tests are passing reliably on my (old) system.
Times are in seconds, and only the times of passes are counted for mean/stdev statistics.</p>

<p>The next step will be adding a true Adjustable Blocksize Cap. This will be where the fun really starts!</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in assisting with the ABC effort, contact us or submit PRs / issues directly on Github!</p>

<h2>parity-unlimited</h2>

<p>There is some more developer interest for giving parity support for bigger blocks.  Personally, I did not find time to continue test experiments with parity-bitcoin or parity-unlimited, but it's been nice to chat with other people on the BU slack about it.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>I've been testing and raising issues on Github for some failing
tests that we are troubleshooting. (I guess it <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/476">started</a>
with the failing <code>pruning.py</code>, but we encountered more
during recent updates meant to close some post-1.0.1.4 gaps.</p>

<p>Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/513">p2p-acceptblock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/537">abandonconflict</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I tested another one with sickpig (<a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/518">validateblocktemplate</a>).</p>

<p>Most if not all these test failures were apparently random failures,
some involving infinite loops.</p>

<p>Random failures can slip through Travis CI undetected, only to surface later.
This seems to have already happened, based on subsequent investigations.</p>

<p>This is a prime reason to run the <em>full</em> test suite (including extended
tests) multiple times a day, on as many platforms as possible.
Fortunately BU's Travis account has been upgraded to a paid one,
at least this means the project will be able to run more tests.</p>

<h3>Running tests repeatedly</h3>

<p>Our parallel testing wrapper for unit tests has an <code>-r</code> option for
repeating tests, but our regression test wrapper (rpc-tests.py) currently
does not. This is something I'd like to enhance, it is frequently needed
because a lot of failures are not deterministic.</p>

<p>One can of course always write a little shell script.
I used this one which runs the test repeatedly using a timeout per run,
logs failures to a temporary file and prints out the total number of
failures at the bottom.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
TIMEOUT=100 # seconds, need to adapt to specific test
TEST_COMMAND="qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py abandonconflict"
for i in {1..100}
do 
   echo "`date`: start iteration $i"
   timeout --foreground $TIMEOUT $TEST_COMMAND || echo "this is a failure"
   killall bitcoind
done | tee /tmp/testfailures.log | grep -c "this is a failure"
</code></pre>

<p>Messy, but it works.</p>

<p>Hopefully, an improved rpc-tests.py will do this for us in future,
and spit out more statistics e.g. average time per run and maybe the
standard deviation of that.</p>

<h3>Bisections</h3>

<p>Once you know a test is failing randomly on a certain revision, you
need to find out what introduced the problem.</p>

<p>If you cannot tell easily, then you can usually get some idea by testing
backwards from a known bad commit (usually the head of the branch you are working off)
to find the first commit that broke the test, and see what it changed.</p>

<p>If the source of the problem possibly lies back a long time, going back
over each revision takes a long time. You can try doing a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBisection">bisection</a>
which is much quicker (but you need to know a working revision sometime in the past).</p>

<p>I submitted a PR for a helper script that can be used in conjunction
with <code>git bisect</code> to run a bisection on a test that is failing
randomly and/or getting stuck in a loop.</p>

<p>I committed the <a href="https://github.com/ftrader/bitcoin-misc-contrib/blob/master/bisection-tools/bisect_probabilistic_with_timeout.sh">original version</a>
of this script in my personal repo under GPLv3, but I submitted it
in improved form in <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/532">PR532</a>.
That PR introduces an additional documentation file with some tips in <code>doc/bug-triage.md</code>.</p>

<p>The script has so far proved quite useful, but it does have limitations,
for example when the build breaks in some past commits. Be sure to read
the file header of the script and the mentioned document if you plan to
use it.</p>

<p>The main benefit is that this script can triage randomly failing and looping tests.
It can be used in "one-shot" mode without running a bisection, of course,
just to either</p>

<ul>
<li>run a test command repeatedly (set a huge timeout if you know the test does not time out)</li>
<li>catch a test which times out (although you can also use the timeout(1) command in Linux)</li>
</ul>


<h2>parity-bitcoin</h2>

<p>I've never dabbled in Rust before, so I was surprised that it was not too
difficult to get to a running version of <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bitcoin">parity-bitcoin</a>.
Fortunately I did have a little help though from Christian Nyumbayire
(Chritchens on the forum and Reddit). He is working on an adaptation of
Parity that he called 'parity-unlimited' and is currently taking shape.
Initial steps will hopefully demonstrate that parity can handle a hardcoded
bigger block size (e.g. 2MB) well.</p>

<p>Here is his announcement thread, in which he also left valuable information
on how to install Parity (some information on installing dependencies got me
past initial hurdles).</p>

<p>https://bitco.in/forum/threads/multi-implementation-client-development.2092/</p>

<p>I was able to successfully run the unmodified parity-bitcoin unit test suite (one
test was ignored but all others passed).
Unfortunately, my initial attempt to run the regression test suite failed -
it got stuck with bitcoinj receiving an empty block header.</p>

<p>Whether this was a problem with my build (I did not build the 'release' build)
or still a bug in the regression tests is something that future trials will
show.</p>

<p>It is already promising that it got very far in the regression tests.
Hopefully it can soon become a big-block capable neighbor of Bitcoin Unlimited
on the actual network.</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>I managed to resolve the little issues that were troubling Travis, and
so complete the merge of recent upstream BU 'dev' into <a href="https://github.com/BTCfork/hardfork_prototype_1_mvf-bu">MVF-BU</a>.</p>

<p>Two long running tests (excessive.py and parallel.py) had to be moved to the
'extended' set of tests which are not automatically run.
This is because BTCfork still operates on a free Travis instance with a
cutoff time of 50 minutes.</p>

<p>The fork code introduces some long-running tests of its own, and these have
to be tested more frequently. However, when touching code that modifies
block handling, it will be necessary to manually run the relocated tests,
and occasionally swap them into Travis for testing across different
build platforms (which I don't have).</p>

<p>I will be starting work on a checkpoint feature next, but more details
about that once it is ready.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin-ABC</h2>

<p>BU contributor deadalnix created a repository of a Bitcoin Core 0.14 client
which has the SegWit and RBF removed.</p>

<p>This can serve as a basis for future Adjustable Blocksize Cap modification,
hence he called it: <a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc">Bitcoin-ABC</a>!</p>

<p>I have started assisting on this effort by helping to resolve some failing
regression tests.  Most of the issues appear due to incomplete removal
of SegWit test code, and should not take too long to clean up.</p>

<p>It would be exciting to have a recent Core with a configurable limit!
Any volunteers are more than welcome to assist this effort.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>Quite a week!  Too much excitement!</p>

<h3>Memory Exhaustion attack, BU release 1.0.1.4</h3>

<p>What began as a gradual decline of BU nodes on the network turned into the sharp decline on 24 April.</p>

<p>Cross-checking with others on Slack and examination of logs followed.
An initial diagnosis of the attack was soon made, as fortunately BU developer Peter Tschipper had already been working on a thinblocks patch that was believed to mitigate this kind of attack.
His patch turned out to be effective, and provided a good first line of defense to the BU network.
Nodes were upgraded within hours, and the patch was reviewed and improved for several hours until it was deemed fit for including in a release.</p>

<p>I will leave an account of the further details to the official BU Incident Report.</p>

<p>By way of this incident, I had opportunity to revisit my Gitian build machine, as I wanted to check if I could participate in verifying the formal release build.
I reconfigured a VM that I had previously set up for doing a Gitian build of other projects (Classic, BTCfork).
This VM had given me some trouble with Gitian builds of Classic, where it produced binaries with different checksums.
I took this chance to see if a similar problem would occur when trying to do a Gitian build for BU.</p>

<p>With instructions provided by Andrea Suisani, I was able to reproduce the Linux release build results.
Unfortunately I noticed that my VM is very slow in comparison to the fast builders used by others.
So in the time it took them to build all platforms, I only managed to build the Linux binaries.
A contributing factor may have been that it was the first time I did the BU build on there, and it had to build all the dependencies first.
Maybe next time will be quicker.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're going for a faster build, you may want to set up the host system on a native machine, and not bother with a separate VM.
Maybe in a while I'll get a faster machine for these kind of builds and tests.</p>

<p>I'm going to provide a link to the <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/release/doc/gitian-building.md">instructions on how to set up a VM or physical system</a> for Bitcoin, and pass on the additional instructions provided to me specifically for BU:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git apt-cacher-ng python-vm-builder ruby qemu-utils
git clone https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited.git BU
cd BU
git checkout release
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:devrandom/gitian-builder.git
cd gitian-builder
./bin/make-base-vm --arch amd64 --suite trusty    # this need to be done only once
# for the --commit flag you need to set a branch or a tag.
# You could use also --num-make #JOBS and --memory MEM (memory to allocate in MiB)
./bin/gbuild --url bitcoin=https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited.git --commit bitcoin=release ../BU/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully these will help someone else achieve a working Gitian build too.
BU needs more people who can do Gitian builds, so that it can respond quickly with hotfix releases.</p>

<h3>Testing for unwanted XthinBlocks code execution</h3>

<p>After it became clear that the vulnerability exploited by the attack was again in thinblocks code, I made a check to gain confidence that BU's <code>--use-thinblocks=0</code> switch was effective.
I instrumented the code with some assert(0) statements as many relevant thinblocks code sections as I could find. These would force a crash if those sections were entered.
This is an easy check that anyone can do for a new feature.
It does not require in-depth understanding of how the feature works - just find all references and apply some common sense while booby-trapping the code.</p>

<p>I found one case where thinblocks code was still executed as part of Xpedited functionality even though I had configured <code>use-thinblocks=0</code> on my node.
This was reported and fixed by Peter Tschipper's pull request <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/486/">486</a></p>

<p>There was general agreement that Xpedited, which depends on thinblocks, should not be enabled if thinblocks is disabled.</p>

<p><em>Personally, I would prefer if every new major feature had a clear switch to turn it on/off.
Even if features are good and useful, I would consider it safer to deploy it with new features disables by default until those features have been tested for a sufficient time, and then set the default to be activated.
On a software development level, this is more effort, but it makes it much easier for most users to get back to a safe operation if there is a problem with the new feature.
Power users may have the ability to run multiple versions of the software at once, but this is probably not the case for the majority of users.
Maybe like Gavin Andresen said, we need to get to know our customers a little more.
It should be sufficient to raise a PR (or a BUIP if want to force a vote on the issue) to change the default on/off setting for a feature, then members can vote and the non-member public can also give their opinions to the discussion.</em></p>

<h3>Pruning</h3>

<p>The pruning feature introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.11 was designed with 1MB blocks in mind,
and needs some adaptation for bigger blocks.
I raised <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/473">issue 473</a> to address this.
It will be needed once we obtain bigger blocks, otherwise pruned nodes on machines with strictly limited space might run over their configured soft limits or even hit hard quotas / run out of disk space completely.</p>

<p>In the PR, I propose a fix that would involve making the minimum number of blocks to retain a configuration item, while keeping the existing <code>prune=&lt;size&gt;</code> parameter.
The user would be warned in case of the pruned size being exceeded, and could choose between keeping less blocks, or increasing the space for pruning.</p>

<p>Jameson Lopp kindly <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/478">pointed out</a> a related consideration - that the AD parameter could influence the minimum number of blocks to be retained in order to be able to perform a re-organization safely.</p>

<p>To start development, I experimented with the <code>pruning.py</code> regression test.
Unfortunately, I found this test, which is normally disabled due to its long runtime and high disk usage (&gt;4GB), to be highly unreliable and afflicted by problems.
It did not pass on the <code>release</code> branch without rolling back to a certain commit, and on the <code>dev</code> branch it went into an endless loop (confirmed by other testers too).</p>

<p>The endless loop behavior led me to open a feature request for loop detection and abort in the test framework (<a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/480">PR 480</a>).</p>

<p>I opened a separate issue to <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/476">collect data</a> about the pruning test status for various environments.
Several contributors assisted with testing. The issue is still being progressed - so far I found one environment where the test passed (if rolled back to a 'healthy' commit).
It seems that there are issues related to the p2p networking which may be interfering and causing client bans and timeouts.
The work on the pruning test definitely involves fixes to the client, and I'm working closely with other developers on that.</p>

<h3>Log privacy considerations</h3>

<p>A Github user raised an issue about <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/472">privacy concerns to do with IP address logging</a> in the BU client.
This is definitely a consideration close to my heart.</p>

<p>Usually the <code>logips=0</code> option should prevent any unnecessary output of IP addresses in the log file and debug console.
What exactly constitutes a need to override this, if at all - this is a question.</p>

<p>Most error messages provide very little information if the network information is not included.
Traditionally these seem to be unprotected by the <code>logips</code> flag.</p>

<p>There are, however, error instances such as 'BAN THRESHOLD EXCEEDED' messages where IP logging should definitely be applied only if requested.</p>

<p>I wonder if it is not simpler to apply the policy that if <code>logips=0</code>, then definitely do not log an IP address.
We may need to output a special abbreviated trace in such cases, if the notification is still important.</p>

<h3>To ban or not to ban (peers)</h3>

<p>In the followup to the memory exhaustion attack, Gregory Maxwell raised Issue 485 on the BU Github:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/485">Short-id collisions allow attackers to cause arbritary bans of thinblock peers</a></p>

<p>Subsequent discussions on BU Slack highlighted a need for further improvements to the thinblock subsystem.
I think BU has a good handle on the issues, and is more aware now that improvements in this area have to be made and assessed very carefully.</p>

<p>One point that is becoming clearer:</p>

<p>If this is left up to the developer to decide, the response can range from "ignore" to "ban immediately", with variations on gradual banning in-between those extremes.
And choosing a too harsh penalty (e.g. immediate ban) can result in <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/477">further problems</a>.</p>

<p>While it would be great to have a consistent policy that software developers could apply to solve every problem around misbehaving peers, I think that is wishful thinking, because attackers are very creative, and the network is anyway a constantly changing sea.</p>

<p>The key lies, I think, in viewing this as policy and giving the node operators the necessary tools to defend their nodes, by making the response more configurable.</p>

<p>I think we should make all Denial-of-Service defense responses tweakable, and have a user menu (and RPC interface) for adjusting them.</p>

<p>Of course, developers still need to think about what a sensible response level for a new protective measure would be.
But they could deliver a parameter file with all the defaults, and let the user easily override the configuration to suit their needs.</p>

<p>If a response is found unsuitable, there is no need to immediately issue a corrective software release - it would be sufficient to publish an advisory notice recommending to change a certain parameter in response to a network threat.</p>

<h3>The 1MB fork transaction</h3>

<p>Last Sunday, someone (/u/1MBforKTR1gAqRLkNbQg) posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6747e2/1mb_fork_txn/">very interesting thread</a> on Reddit which contained a link to a very large transaction which, if mined, would create a block &gt; 1MB and thereby create a chain fork.</p>

<p>This proposal soon turned up as a <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/issues/464">change request</a> to BU to allow such transactions to be pushed (p2p) over the network.
On the same day, it was also submitted to Core, who <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10266">rejected it without much discussion</a>.</p>

<p>I replied to the BU issue and PR, stating why I did not think such a change was needed (a miner wishing to create a &gt; 1MB fork chain could mine the transaction already).
However, I was open to arguing the case for/against it.</p>

<p>For some reason, the poster who raised the issue did not respond with more rationale on BU's issue tracker after my enquiry.
I was a little disappointed to find a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68d4r1/1mb_txn_update/">Reddit update post</a> from them which stated that 'No one else reached out'.
We did reach out and try to discuss their pull request!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have little discussion on the PR so far, with everyone attending to other urgent matters.
I presume this will result in the issue being closed if the poster does not engage further.</p>

<p>As was also pointed out, the poster holds the keys to funds donated to that the addresses in that transaction.
I like the improvements suggested by /u/edmundedgar in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6747e2/1mb_fork_txn/dgnvgss/">this comment thread</a> on the original proposal:</p>

<p>In my opinion, the ability for separate coins by using the 'faucet' feature of this transaction is one of the interesting aspects of this proposal.
Perhaps something like this can be leveraged by an exchange or miner willing to produce such a block.
I would definitely be more relaxed about the keys for such a transaction being in known hands.</p>

<h3>The road to CompactBlocks</h3>

<p>This week's other issues left no time for me to start deeper investigation of CompactBlocks.
Other devs have expressed interest in an experimental branch for it, and there is positive support expressed for it in <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip051-add-compactblocks-support.2017/">BUIP051</a>. This makes me optimistic that it can be put up for vote and perhaps even reach agreement for implementation.</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>After the recent merge from upstream BU 'dev' branch, there were some minor leftover issues manifesting as test failures.
These were mainly related to build system changes and <a href="http://python3porting.com/differences.html">moving from Python2 to Python3</a>.
Those have been fixed, and happily upstream BU did not break any of the fork-related functionality - all tests pass.
Fortunately we did have good unit tests in the <code>arith.py</code> module, which helped when troubleshooting an integer division problem which broke the mvf-bu-retarget.py test (wrong expected difficulty after reset).
The problem turned out to be in the helper procedure that emulates the C++ difficulty adjustment algorithm.
On Python3 scripts need to use floor division (//) otherwise a floating point division will be performed.
This resulted in a slightly different difficulty value, and for a while I was worried that the upstream merge might have subtly changed something about the fork trigger and resulting difficulty reset.</p>

<p>A remaining problem now is that one Travis test fails because it checks the code formatting (using clang-format).
This currently fails for some of the code which MVF modified, so those source files will need to be reformatted.
I'm hoping to get around to that in a day or two, as soon as I have a native clang-format on my old development box.
I've decided to build LLVM / Clang from source on there. I was shocked to find that the LLVM+clang(+extra tools) build took up 40GB of disk space, and at times I had to reduce the number of parallel build threads to just one because my memory was being exhausted by the build! I think I would recommend just installing clang through your package manager <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>Before I merge from upstream again, I'll await some stabilization on BU's 'dev' branch after the recent memory exhaustion attack fixes.
There is still much work ongoing to polish those fixes and make BU's custom thinblock and expedited code as robust as possible.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>I raised <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip051-add-compactblocks-support.2017/">BUIP051</a>, am going to take a close look at porting those changes over from XT during the coming week or two.</p>

<p>Happily, the proposal to spend some money for a better (paid) Travis build service has met with a supportive reception at BU, so I think we are soon going to have the possibility to run longer test suites (up to 120 minutes each - maybe need to break the test suite down into several batches which individually fit in under 2 hrs, or just execute randomly and time out just below 2 hrs).</p>

<p>Parallel execution of regression tests might be helpful. I'm planning to add that feature to BU's rpc-tests.py (Core has had that feature <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/fa494dec79b9d469b7eb38d2f0b8cf9832cdc398">for a while</a>).</p>

<p>Until then, I've <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/463">pull-requested some minor test runner improvements</a> I made in MVF-BU, to allow execution of single tests with specific arguments, and allow one-off test runs of disabled tests. This should make it a little easier for testers to run disabled tests - now they don't have to edit the rpc-tests.py script code to temporarily enable a test.</p>

<p>Some nice changes from Classic have been <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/460">ported to BU by kyuupichan</a>: the improved command line parameter handling which prevents invalid parameters from being silently ignored at startup.</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>Finally got around to merging the latest Bitcoin Unlimited dev branch changes back into MVF-BU. Turned out to be something like 1200+ commits - who said BU isn't developmentally active? <img src="./smileys/smile4.png" alt=";-)" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Travis is not yet completely happy with my merge - it seems some build environment changes or file movements have broken the test framework.
My own 32-bit test system also needs to upgrade to a C++11 compiler to handle the upstream compiler requirement changes.
All in all, these seems like minor things that can be cleaned up fairly quickly - over the course of the next few days.
After that, MVF-BU will be back on track for further development.</p>

<h2>Extension blocks or bigger regular blocks</h2>

<p>After Gregory Maxwell's recent post on bitcoin-dev, the clamor for UASF SegWit seems to have died down a bit - maybe it's just on the back burner.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Unlimited seems to be within good reach of regular big blocks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tothemoon-org/extension-blocks/blob/master/spec.md">Extension Blocks</a> looks like another promising idea, but quite a complex undertaking in comparison to straightforward big blocks.</p>

<p>Maybe Mr Bitcoin will place an order for both, and see which one the kitchen can deliver first?</p>

<h2>Thoughts on verification and validation in Bitcoin projects</h2>

<p>To recap the difference between verification and validation:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Verification:</dt>
<dd>
Does the software work right (according to the specified requirements)?
</dd>
<dt>Validation:</dt>
<dd>
Does it do the right thing (are the requirements correct, consistent, complete, ...)?
</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Thinking globally</h2>

<p>If Bitcoin manages to grow out of its current stagnation - and I remain optimistic - then it could become a component of human civilization that is just as important as the Internet, or whatever will replace our global communications medium in 20-100 years.  We want to be able to trust this Bitcoin software with our money, which can be life and death matter.</p>

<p>Imagine you need to pay for medical treatment for yourself or a loved one using Bitcoin.  What if the system has a bug and now your funds have been transferred to another recipient than intended?</p>

<p>It is very important that we ensure the best possible engineering practices in our work on this new technology.
In our automated world, software errors <a href="https://raygun.com/blog/10-costly-software-errors-history/">are becoming increasingly costly</a>.
The "high-end" ones listed there are in the region of up to $500M . I offer a humble prediction:</p>

<p> <em><strong>The most costly software mistakes of the near future will belong to cryptocurrency projects.</strong></em></p>

<p>Hopefully not Bitcoin though <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>At this time, Bitcoin <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com">market cap</a> stands at around $19B .
A serious bug could easily halve this, leading to severe losses for many individual users.
Nobody wants to be the responsible developer, reviewer, tester or project leader who let a major bug slip through the cracks.
Fortunately, as I look around today, there are plenty of source projects which work in exemplary ways from which we can draw inspiration for Bitcoin and avoid pitfalls.
So let's look outside of our cryptocurrency box for a moment.</p>

<h3>Virtuous example 1: Linux kernel project</h3>

<p>Around April 2003 (as far as I can tell), Craig Thomas of Open Source Development Lab released a paper, which I would encourage you to have a look at (or read again) if you have some free time on this long weekend:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<a href="http://flosshub.org/system/files/133-136.pdf">Improving Verification, Validation, and Test of the Linux Kernel: the Linux Stabilization Project</a>" <a href="#footnote2">[2]</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the time, the Linux kernel was moving towards version 2.6, experiencing great uptake, with lots of contributors growing the size of the project.
Reading just the first four sections of the paper, the similarities to the state of the Bitcoin "project" (in a bigger sense) are quite evident.
How does this sound:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Since there are no formal specifications for many of the features of the <del>kernel</del> protocol" (replacement mine)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="./images/tux_big.svg"><img src="./images/tux_big.svg" alt="Tux, the Linux penguin" class="img" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Or this:</p>

<blockquote><p>"While many people contribute features and patches to the <del>kernel</del> protocol, very few people actually take a disciplined approach to testing it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Looking back now, we can say that the Linux project did a good job at solving its problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of specification: addressed through the <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lsb/start">Linux Standards Base</a></li>
<li>lack of test coverage: addressed through the <a href="https://linux-test-project.github.io/">Linux Test Project</a></li>
</ul>


<p>We would do well to emulate Linux in setting up similar projects for Bitcoin, which could span various client implementations while focusing on a set of 'base' protocol features.
After all, our various client projects (Core, Knots, XT, Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc.) are similar to Linux distributions based loosely off a common "kernel" of features.</p>

<p>It is my hope that someday, we will have a "Bitcoin Standards Base" and a "Bitcoin Test Project" to cover multiple needs in the industry and advise people, whether they be users wanting to assist or projects/businesses wanting to use the technology or develop it further.</p>

<h3>Virtuous example 2: Wikimedia organization</h3>

<p>Another good example of a project to emulate in terms of openness is <a href="https://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia.org</a>.</p>

<p>They have their entire code review and integration test pipeline publicly visible, including for the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> framework, the software that powers Wikipedia. Some examples of the verification related data they publish:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wikimedia CI dashboard: https://grafana.wikimedia.org/dashboard/db/continuous-integration?orgId=1</li>
<li>Jenkins CI server: https://integration.wikimedia.org/ci/</li>
<li>Code review (using Gerrit): https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/q/status:open</li>
<li>Code test coverage: https://doc.wikimedia.org/cover/</li>
<li>Test cluster health stats: https://tools.wmflabs.org/nagf/?project=integration</li>
</ul>


<p>Having this information publicly available greatly helps those who want to get involved, whether as developers or testers.</p>

<p>This is all built on free or open source software, so it feeds an ecosystem that can grow into the future, unconstrained by small-scale profit motives.</p>

<p>For a Bitcoin client, I would presume it would be natural that not only the software is open source, but also all the data and research related to it - i.e. input and results of tests, simulations etc. <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open source</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">open data</a> (the blockchain is a perfect example), <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/os/def.en.html">open standards</a> <a href="#footnote3">[3]</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access">open access</a>. Did I miss anything? Maybe "open infrastructure/integration" - ensuring that the project infrastructure allows individuals and other organization to easily "plug in" through a variety of software interfaces, to feed in data and extract it.</p>

<h3>Virtuous example 3: NASA (you said you want to go the moon!)</h3>

<p>In my software career, I have come across extremely helpful bits within the mountains of information that NASA publishes.
A good point to start would be <a href="https://code.nasa.gov/">https://code.nasa.gov/</a> !</p>

<p>If we ignore the "Projects" for now, and navigate to the "<a href="https://code.nasa.gov/#/guide">Guide</a>" section, we find some interesting further links:</p>

<blockquote><p>Software release at NASA is governed by <a href="http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&amp;c=2210&amp;s=1C">NPR 2210.1C</a>. NPR 2210.1C establishes the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for reporting, reviewing, and releasing software under various conditions, including open source.</p></blockquote>

<p>The link which I've embedded goes to NODIS, the NASA Online Directives Information System - a search engine for information on agency directives. This looks dry, but contains a ton of useful information, if one digs a little. For example, the previous "Guide" page also mentions:</p>

<blockquote><p>NASA has established formal software engineering requirements in NPR 7150.2A. These requirements govern all software development activities and must be followed throughout a project's development life cycle.</p></blockquote>

<p>We can <a href="https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/npr_sort.cfm">use NODIS to locate</a> this "NPR 7150.2A". Actually, it tells us that it has been replaced by an updated revision, NPR 7150.2B:</p>

<p><a href="https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002B_">https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002B_</a></p>

<p>In the preface, this contains an interesting picture to give an overview of the kinds of software that NASA needs to manage.</p>

<table class="img"><caption>Figure 1-1 NASA Software Classification Structure</caption><tr><td><a href="./images/NPR7150.002BP1G1.png"><img src="./images/NPR7150.002BP1G1.png" width="593" height="532" alt="Figure 1-1 NASA Software Classification Structure" class="img" /></a></td></tr></table>


<p>Let's say you had to pay for your moon rocket in bitcoins.
Where would you put Bitcoin software, in that classification?</p>

<p>The parts of NPR7150.2B that will be of more interest as potential inspiration to those concerned with serious software development are the "meat chapters" 3-6:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002B_&amp;page_name=Chapter3">Chapter 3: Software Management Requirements</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002B_&amp;page_name=Chapter4">Chapter 4: Software Engineering Life-Cycle Requirements</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002B_&amp;page_name=Chapter5">Chapter 5. Supporting Software Life-Cycle Requirements</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002B_&amp;page_name=Chapter6">Chapter 6. Recommended Software Documentation Contents</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Chapter 3, while apparently about "management" (rolls eyes), has valuable guidance in there. Don't be put off.
Especially section 3.7, "Safety-critical software" - this is not just applicable to space station software!
Let's take some tidbits of advice!</p>

<pre><code>a. Safety-critical software is initialized, at first start and at restarts, to a known safe state.
d. Operator overrides of safety-critical software functions require at least two independent actions by an operator.
g. Safety-critical software performs integrity checks on inputs and outputs to/from the software system.  
k. Software provides error handling of safety-critical functions. 
</code></pre>

<p>Ch. 4 contains this piece of wisdom:</p>

<p><code>4.1.1 The requirements phase is one of the most important phases of software engineering. Studies show that the top problems in the software industry are due to poor requirements elicitation, inadequate requirements specification, and inadequate management of changes to requirements. Requirements provide the foundation for the entire life-cycle, as well as for the software product.</code></p>

<p>And it goes on to say about testing (for "project manager" you can also read "lead maintainer", "The Developer", "CTO" or just "you" as a software developer in a Bitcoin context):</p>

<p><code>4.5.3 The project manager shall perform software testing. [SWE-066]</code></p>

<p><code>Note: A best practice for Class A, B, and C software projects is to have formal software testing planned, conducted, witnessed, and approved by an independent organization outside of the development team. Testing could include software integration testing, systems integration testing, validation testing, end-to-end testing, acceptance testing, white and black box testing, decision and path analysis, statistical testing, stress testing, performance testing, regression testing, qualification testing, simulation, and others. The use of automated software testing tools is also to be considered in software testing. Test breadth and accuracy can be increased through the use of test personnel independent of the software design and implementation teams, software peer reviews and inspections of software test procedures and software test results, and employing impartial test witnesses.</code></p>

<p>Fortunately, if you keep your code, tests and records publicly accessible, you are well on your way to independent review!
(However, occasionally it pays to call in experts to assist, if you are involved in Bitcoin in some professional endeavour.)</p>

<p>Having more diversity of implementations around the common protocol also helps keep everyone's work in check.</p>

<h3>Acting locally - what can we do to strengthen our projects (e.g. Bitcoin Unlimited)</h3>

<p>First, we can (re-)acquaint ourselves with <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse870/IEEEXplore-SRS-template.pdf">IEEE Std 830-1998</a> (IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications) which gives extremely solid guidance on how to construct good software requirements specs. Of course, applying it is needed, but reading is definitely a first step.</p>

<p>Technical proposals are currently often too informal. This applies to technical BUIPs as well, which still lag behind BIPs or proposal like "ToTheMoon"'s Extension Blocks a little in terms of rigor.</p>

<p>Next up, we need to follow better practices in constructing the software, verifying and validating properly.
Get the project's test results (records) to be archived in a decentralized way (i.e. in a separate software repository), instead of in <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/411#issuecomment-291995986">ephemeral comment threads on Github</a>.
Of course, testers should sign off on test evidence in some way. Signed commits in a Git repository would do the trick.</p>

<p>Regression test suites are lacking coverage and need to be extended.
It not surprising when requirements are lacking - developers tend to interpret everything according to their own whims in that case.</p>

<p>Regression tests should be run automatically and regularly, to catch any bugs that may creep in with future changes.
Bitcoin projects attract a wide spectrum of practitioners, with different levels of experience etc.
Even experienced software developers can struggle for quite some time with the complexities of the current (somewhat legacy) codebase.
During this time, they are apt to make more mistakes.
Good test coverage is the safety net that's nearly always there <img src="./smileys/smile.png" alt=":-)" /></p>

<p>Currently, BU uses Travis for continuous integration testing on pull requests and merge commits.
I raised <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip052-set-up-dedicated-continuous-integration.2034/">BUIP052</a> specifically to add more test coverage using daily/nightly runs of the full test suite (which is currently only partially exercised by Travis). Nowadays there are a lot of options when it comes to CI services, and they are affordable to even small projects (many offer free time to free software projects).
Other contributors have pointed out additional ways of approaching the problem, such as build farms with hardware run by project contributors.</p>

<p>A good exercise for a Bitcoin project is to draw up a proper V&amp;V plan describing how it's handled, the infrastructure, what records are produced, etc.
I haven't seen such a document in any of the Satoshi client projects so far.</p>

<p>If there is anything more frustrating for a developer than not knowing what the overall test status is of the code they are working on, then it is having to wait for a long time for tests to finish. I submitted a little tool to BU and Classic, which can execute Bitcoin's C++ unit tests in parallel on a multi-core machine.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/452">https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/452</a></p>

<p>On my workstation this cuts down the time from 199s to 59s, for a full run of all unit tests.
Practically, it is of course limited by the longest test. Still, it helps a bit.</p>

<p>Wishing all of you a peaceful Easter weekend!</p>

<h1>Welcome to freetrader's weekly musings (new)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've decided to write up a little weekly retrospective.
My goal is to share some thoughts, notes and tips for those
who wish to delve into Bitcoin development or support
the current efforts of the community to address the
on-chain scaling problems.</p>

<p>Since this is the first of these episodes, I'll touch on
some other topics as well which I think might interest
some of you who've been following things in the 'forking'
realm.</p>

<h2>What's happening with BTCfork?</h2>

<p>I must say I've neglected BTCfork a little in the
last two months while devoting more time to BU.
My last stint on BTCfork was to get Travis CI properly
working on the project's MVF repos, which it is now,
and starting to set up automated consistency checks for
the requirements and design specifications (which should
later be extended to cover the code as well - more about
this later).</p>

<p>Travis CI turned out to be quite easy to set up, based
on the good work of the base projects (Bitcoin Unlimited
and Core). The only snag to watch out for when setting
up Travis on a Bitcoin fork project is that one will
need to contact Travis support to allow the project,
because such projects are automatically identified as
doing Bitcoin mining (during their automated tests).
Obviously CI providers don't want their resources to
be used up by people doing Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>Travis support staff were awesome and resolved the
issue right away. I can only recommend the service to
anyone.</p>

<p>The next step in MVF-BU will be to rebase on latest
BU release. I am waiting for a next regular release
(more bugfixes after the recent exploit hotfixes).</p>

<h2>Why not fork right now?!</h2>

<p>As the recent black hat exploits against BU 1.0.1 version
showed, bugs are easily introduced, and there are
no doubt sleeping ones that we do not know about
yet, but attackers might.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is necessary that we upgrade MVF-BU to
the most recent BU patches, otherwise it can be
trivially attacked right now.
I'll probably end up manually rebasing the MVF changes on
latest BU instead of trying to merge from upstream,
as when I looked at the merge set it was more than
400 files with many collisions.</p>

<p>Secondly, there's still quite a bit of work to
be done on the MVF regarding clean network separation.</p>

<p>It may well be that the big-blocks front (BU, Classic, XT,
probably others too like <a href="https://github.com/whitslack/bitcoin-infinity">Infinity</a>)
soon gets enough miner support for a majority fork.</p>

<p>In that case, I am most likely going to resume my
work on BTCfork only after assisting wherever I can
with BU. They have done a great job at attracting
more support from the broad community, and they are
really putting a lot of effort into improving the
quality of their code - a process which I'm grateful
and happy to be able to participate in.</p>

<h2>Code quality improvements in Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>I'm going to mention a few things I've seen that
give me reason to be very optimistic about code
quality in BU and neighboring projects.</p>

<p>Firstly, BU has embarked on a mission of cleaning
up the C++ code by enforcing automated style checks,
using clang-format and some custom tools to
sensibly arrange comments.</p>

<p>This is being trial-run on the files which have
been introduced by BU, and will probably be
either rolled out incrementally as further files
are modified, or applied to the whole codebase
in a 'flag day' run.</p>

<p>Either way, a long-hoped dream of developers
will come true as the code comes out looking
much more readable, and can be kept that way
by the CI checks and more tools provided to developers.</p>

<p>BU lead dev Andrew Stone has also declared that
commented code sections introduced by BU can
be cleanup up now. This process has started in
earnest <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, BU is in the process of examining the
code - both its own additions and the existing
base - for more lurking bugs.
I can't reveal much more, but to say that I'm
satisfied that the project is fully aware of
good practice and starting to implement it
carefully.</p>

<p>This also applies to code reviews on Github.</p>

<p>I spent several hours reviewing PRs in BU,
and I'm very happy to see other devs like
Tom Zander assist with excellent code review inputs.</p>

<p>In some cases, developers have found that
automated testing is very difficult to apply to
their change using the existing frameworks for
unit tests and 'qa' (regression) tests.</p>

<p>A proposal would be that rather than silently merging
PRs which are affected by this "difficulty to test",
the developers should try to explain (on Github) why
the code changes are not readily testable by the
existing automated frameworks. This would open the
discussion and examination. In some cases, maybe
a better solution could be found either by adapting
the change, or by enhancing a framework.</p>

<p>If there is absolutely no direct solution, then
there is a still a remaining option to test such
changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>write up a manual test script which a tester can perform.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not very unusual in legacy applications which
were not developed from the ground up with automated
testing in mind.</p>

<p>For example, the bitcoin-qt graphical user interface
(GUI) is not automatically tested at all.
It would be very helpful if there were documented
test procedures for such areas where manual testing
is still the only solution.</p>

<p>Right now, BU has started using Github PR threads
to record when we do manual test steps and what
results are obtained by reviewers/testers who
try to verify by testing.
But long-term, this is also not optimal, because
the test knowledge remains buried in some PRs and
will be difficult to find again.</p>

<p>Much better will be if projects can start to
keep manual test procedures in version control
together with the code, for example in a
<code>doc/manual_tests</code> folder.</p>

<p>The test procedures need to be specific enough
for the most part so that a tester can treat the
software as a black box - just set it up as
instructed, perform the listed steps and check
for some expected outputs.</p>

<p>On previous projects I worked on, such manual tests
were automated over time as test frameworks became
mature enough.</p>

<p>A side benefit of committing test procedures and
test results to a repository is that the evidence
of testing becomes public.</p>

<p>It strikes me as obvious that a lot of testing is
done on the Bitcoin codebase, but much of it is not
adequately (publicly) recorded, and thus becomes
'lost' to others. In fact, others may even doubt that
it has taken place.
And they should doubt that is has been
tested adequately <em>and correctly</em> if the evidence is
not public.</p>

<h3>Improving Python code quality</h3>

<p>There is quite a bit of Python code in the client.
In BU it is ~100 files, with about 11,5 KLOC in the
<code>qa/</code> folder alone. Most of this code has not been
run through the standard tools used to keep Python
code clean, like <code>flake8</code> and <code>pylint</code>.
Or if it has, it was a long time ago, because it
has deteriorated. It would be helpful to clean all
that code up too, not just the C++ code.</p>

<p>Such Python cleanup is also quite easy to put in
automated tools and scripts to help developers.
Style checks can be enforced through CI as well.</p>

<p>As an example of cleanup, I have <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/pull/248">applied some basic tools</a>
on a test which was modified by Bitcoin Classic.</p>

<p>I am planning to write a helper script which will
make it easier to run such cleanup on all Python scripts.</p>

<h2>On improving specifications in Bitcoin, part 1</h2>

<p>Before writing software, I prefer to think about the
problem first, and come up with a set of requirements,
and design changes. In my experience, the time invested
in this more than pays for itself.</p>

<p>Specification can be done even when faced with a legacy
application to which you intend to make incremental changes.
An example would be the set of 'forking' changes made in
the MVFs to their baseline clients (BU and Core).</p>

<p>In the Bitcoin world, currently we are used to BIPs
and BUIPs providing specifications of changes.</p>

<p>So far, these specifications are relatively informal,
if we look at them from an engineering point of view.
They currently span a gamut of levels without clear
layering. You will find bits of C++ code in BIPs,
when pseudocode would be more useful and
intelligible to readers who are not necessarily
C++ programmers.</p>

<p>Good specifications must cover several levels, from the
birds-eye view of the end user, to the software
design decisions.
It is not practical to expect all of this from a
single document like a BIP.</p>

<p>But these different levels of specification are needed
for various parties to easily obtain and digest the
information they need about working with and maintaining
the system. So we can see that the Bitcoin project has
quite a large gap to fill in addressing the need for
a good specification.</p>

<p>Good requirements <a href="#footnote2">[2]</a> in particular help everyone to:</p>

<ul>
<li>record and identify what is the expected behavior of the system</li>
<li>assess whether its actual behavior is in line with expectation, or whether the system needs corrections or enhancement</li>
<li>reduce communicative friction when talking about particular aspects of its behavior</li>
</ul>


<p>Requirements should be clear and identifiable.
Where necessary, they can introduce special, well-defined
terms and it is better if they use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">formal language</a> <a href="#footnote3">[3]</a> to
rule out ambiguity.</p>

<p>They need to be easily referenced by other documents
related to a system, e.g. design documents, test documents,
even bug reports.</p>

<p>Usually, high-level requirements are translated into
low-level requirements (e.g. user requirements are
refined into system requirement, which in turn can be
refined into even lower-level software requirements).</p>

<p>The software requirements in turn are what drives
the design of the software, which leads to
implemented code.</p>

<p>If you want to have reasonable assurance that the
code has been implemented to meet the requirements,
it helps to be able to trace the work done - from
the requirements, through the design, to the actual
code code - and back. This traceability helps with
controlling quality, because it makes it easier to
check that the code covers the features it is supposed
to, and does not do things for which no-one asked.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, maintaining software is a
difficult and expensive task whose effort can grow
substantially as the size of the codebase increases.
Nobody wants to maintain features that no-one uses.</p>

<p>In the BTCfork context I decided right away that we
want to have a better requirements and design specification.
This requires a bit of tooling to ensure consistency
between the requirements and design, and what ends up in
the code.
I've begun to write such a tool, <a href="https://github.com/ftrader/spec_checker.git">spec_checker</a>
which can cross-check the textual requirements and design
documents automatically when changes are made to them.</p>

<p>In conjunction with a CI system, this tool can be used
to report when changes are made that leave the specification
(and later: the software too) in an inconsistent state.</p>

<p>To see an example of its usage in conjunction with Travis,
you can look at how it is enabled in <a href="https://github.com/ftrader/bitcoinfork-collaborative-spec/commit/84e7e124306781cb820676d61e8ad809b305caa3">this commit</a>
on the <code>bitcoinfork-collaborative-spec</code> repo.</p>

<p>Of course, BTCfork's MVF specifications are still
incomplete, and the tool does not yet check whether
the requirements are properly traced down to the
code level.</p>

<p>It's a first step in that direction - more steps are needed.
This will be the first of many 'instalments' on the topic
of specifications, what we can improve in Bitcoin,
and how we can get to a proper specification of the
protocol - a huge topic and endeavour for sure.
But it can be done.</p>
