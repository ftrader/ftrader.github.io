<h1>Weekly musing #22 - Troubleshooting, buildbot</h1>

<h2>Bitcoin ABC</h2>

<p>I found a partial solution to <a href="https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/issues/80">ABC issue 80</a>,
which is a problem of pre-fork transactions showing up with wrong dates after import of private keys from older
wallets.</p>

<p>Transaction dates are assigned using a selection of heuristics during a re-scan, some of which produce very strange (wrong) results.
A workaround to some of these problems was described by user 'dooglus' in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6662">Core issue 6662</a>.
However, it does not solve all problems. I'm looking at the wallet code to familiarize myself with it.</p>

<p>Other small fixes are being made in preparation for next release.</p>

<h2>buildbot</h2>

<p>I've looked at the <a href="https://buildbot.net/">buildbot</a> software, which deadalnix mentioned a few times.</p>

<p>It seems a great fit for ABC's (and the wider Bitcoin Cash clients) testing needs.</p>

<p>We could set up a structure of master servers and people could contribute worker instances on various platforms.</p>

<p>I am in the process of setting up some hosted servers (a build master and worker for starters) which should be able to run builds and perform tests.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the ZCash project is also using buildbot, with Amazon Web Services. We might look at that later on.
For the beginning I think we can run workers on our own dedicated servers.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>Bitcoin Unlimited has tagged BUcash v1.1.1.1 , which should be out shortly.
A great set of changes.</p>

<p>For some reason my OSX gitian build for BU is broken (SSL certificate problems with curl).</p>
