<h2>Bitcoin Unlimited</h2>

<p>I raised <a href="https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip051-add-compactblocks-support.2017/">BUIP051</a>, am going to take a close look at porting those changes over from XT during the coming week or two.</p>

<p>Happily, the proposal to spend some money for a better (paid) Travis build service has met with a supportive reception at BU, so I think we are soon going to have the possibility to run longer test suites (up to 120 minutes each - maybe need to break the test suite down into several batches which individually fit in under 2 hrs, or just execute randomly and time out just below 2 hrs).</p>

<p>Parallel execution of regression tests might be helpful. I'm planning to add that feature to BU's rpc-tests.py (Core has had that feature <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/fa494dec79b9d469b7eb38d2f0b8cf9832cdc398">for a while</a>).</p>

<p>Until then, I've <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/463">pull-requested some minor test runner improvements</a> I made in MVF-BU, to allow execution of single tests with specific arguments, and allow one-off test runs of disabled tests. This should make it a little easier for testers to run disabled tests - now they don't have to edit the rpc-tests.py script code to temporarily enable a test.</p>

<p>Some nice changes from Classic have been <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/460">ported to BU by kyuupichan</a>: the improved command line parameter handling which prevents invalid parameters from being silently ignored at startup.</p>

<h2>BTCfork</h2>

<p>Finally got around to merging the latest Bitcoin Unlimited dev branch changes back into MVF-BU. Turned out to be something like 1200+ commits - who said BU isn't developmentally active? <img src="../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";-)" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Travis is not yet completely happy with my merge - it seems some build environment changes or file movements have broken the test framework.
My own 32-bit test system also needs to upgrade to a C++11 compiler to handle the upstream compiler requirement changes.
All in all, these seems like minor things that can be cleaned up fairly quickly - over the course of the next few days.
After that, MVF-BU will be back on track for further development.</p>

<h2>Extension blocks or bigger regular blocks</h2>

<p>After Gregory Maxwell's recent post on bitcoin-dev, the clamor for UASF SegWit seems to have died down a bit - maybe it's just on the back burner.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Unlimited seems to be within good reach of regular big blocks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tothemoon-org/extension-blocks/blob/master/spec.md">Extension Blocks</a> looks like another promising idea, but quite a complex undertaking in comparison to straightforward big blocks.</p>

<p>Maybe Mr Bitcoin will place an order for both, and see which one the kitchen can deliver first?</p>
